# zsh-dl: Basic Downloader

`zsh-dl` is a tool for downloading and post-processing files.

Actually, that's not quite right. Really, its a framework for workflows that consume and process lines. It provides chaining, concurrency and logging, as well as a cli for dispatching to those workflows designed with brevity in mind.

The tool itself doesn't actually do any downloading or processing. Instead, it is used to define handlers for tree/case-type logic with shell functions[^1], which can then in turn call out to tools on your system[^2].

In my daily use, it usually feels something like a context-dependent amalgamation of shell aliases, for quickly downloading, previewing, and processing whatever is on my clipboard.


```zsh
# downloads the folder into your current directory
dl - "https://github.com/Squirreljetpack/zsh-dl/tree/main/config"

# Reads from clipboard:
# https://www.reddit.com/r/proceduralgeneration/comments/1g5xi6j/a_skull_made_in_a_pixel_shader_no_mesh_no/
dl # a_skull_made_in_a_pixel_shader_-_no_mesh_no_geometry_just_code.mkv

# The unique prefix of a config acts as a subcommand/mode switch
# The following are ruled by alternate.ini:
dl a - "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5ihnPWKJZU" # Downloads audio
# Downloads images (would be video without 'a')
dl a - "https://www.reddit.com/r/interesting/comments/1l114tz/an_arctic_weather_station_on_abandoned_kolyuchin/"
```

[^1]: Currently, by parsing input according to protocol, and then matching the parsed data with globs.
[^2]: i.e. `curl`, `ssh`, or `yt-dlp`.

## Key Features

### 🚀 Plug and Play

- Built-in handlers for:

  - GitHub/GitLab repositories (download folders/files/branches)

  - Media downloads (images/videos/audio)[^2]

  - Download webpages and books[^4] as markdown

  - Repository, webpage, file, ssh and info previews[^5]

  - Multithreaded, chunked and resumable downloads

- Post-processors chains formatting and conversion

- Reads urls as input directly from your clipboard

- Uses [lt](https://github.com/Squirreljetpack/lt) if installed for hassle-free destination determination

### ⚙ Simple Configuration

- Declare handlers and postprocessors for various input types:

- Define different configs for processing input of different types or in different modes

```ini
# config/default.ini
http.my_handler="example.com/*" # Handle urls beginning with example.com/ with an http.myhandler you define
http.default:markdown="*" # Download all other http/s urls with curl, and convert them to markdown

# Additionally:
# - using | as the first seperator allows matching multiple patterns
# - and multiple processors can be chained, like so:
# http.default|markdown:htmlify

ZSHDL_THREADS=5 # 5 download threads
```

```shell
# Run with
dl - "https://jless.io/user-guide"
# or
dl < urls.txt
# or just
dl # read from your clipboard
```

### 🧩 Extensionality

The base functionality is pretty sparse. But for my own use case, there's only a few types of behavior I want depending what's on my clipboard, which zsh-dl makes easy to define and invoke:

- Define handlers directly in Zsh: no fussing about documentation and DSL's.

- Reuse components across different protocols

```shell
# The diagram goes
# Internal: [INPUT] -> [PROTOCOL HANDLER] -> [PROTOCOL-SPECIFIC HANDLER] ->
# Modular : [HANDLER] (❤️ You are here) -> [POSTPROCESSOR] -> ... ->
# -> [OUTPUT] (+ logging)


# config/handlers.zsh
file.fmt_ruff() {
  file=$1
  [[ -e ~/ruff_$FORMAT.toml ]] &&
    opts+=(--config ~/ruff_$FORMAT.toml) ||
    opts=()
  ruff format $opts $1
}
```

```ini
# config/fmt.ini
file.fmt_ruff="*.py" # handle python files with fmt_ruff
file.fmt_biome="*.(js|ts|tsx|jsx|astro|html|css)"
```

```shell
# format all your files with strict settings
> FORMAT=strict dl --config fmt *

# or just
> dl f * # format all your files with default settings
```

See [Configuration](#handlers-and-preprocessors) for the actual inputs provided to and outputs expected of these handlers.

### 📊 Logging & Statistics

- SQLite database tracks history per config

- Skip past executions

- Retry failed downloads

```shell
> dl -s
┌────┬────────────────┬──────────────────────────────────────────┬──────────────────────────────────────────┬──────────────────────────────┬──────┐
│ ID │      Time      │                  Target                  │                 Message                  │         Destination          │ St.  │

```

### 📋 Task management

- Queue your input, cancel anytime, and resume where you left off

- More on the way

# Installation

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Squirreljetpack/zsh-dl.git
cd zsh-dl
./install.zsh
```

The installer will prompt you for what to name the executable as. The default is dl but you may want to choose a longer name and create a shell alias instead.

### Dependencies

zsh-dl relies on the following external command-line tools. Certain functionality will be disabled without them:

- [lt](https://github.com/Squirreljetpack/lt): For determining download destination.
- [sqlite3](https://www.sqlite.org/download.html): For logging.
- clipboard commands (xclip/pbcopy[^7]): For reading from clipboard.

[^7]: preinstalled on Mac

You surely already have these:

- curl: For HTTP/HTTPS downloads.
- rsync: For SSH/SFTP transfers.
- git: For cloning repositories.
- tar: For extracting archives.
- file: For determining file and MIME types.

And the predefined handlers/postprocessors are just wrappers around these:

- [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp)
- [gallery-dl](https://github.com/mikf/gallery-dl)
- [html2markdown](https://github.com/JohannesKaufmann/html-to-markdown)
- [Ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff) / [Biome](https://github.com/biomejs/biome) / [shellfmt](https://github.com/mvdan/sh)

All these can be easily reconfigured through setting variables or writing a handler.

# Usage

```

Subcommands:
  config            : Use <config|DEFAULT>.ini in /home/archr/.config/zsh-dl as the config.
                        A unique prefix can be specified instead as well.
Options:
  - <input>        : Process <input> instead of reading from stdin/clipboard.

  -h                : Display this help message and exit.
  -l […log_ids]     : Show the log for the given log_ids.
                        'n:' to display the last n logs
                        '.s' to filter by status
  --from [log_id=0] : Retry failed downloads.
  -s                : Skip inputs which succeded in the past.
  -v                : Set verbosity 2.

# Configuration

Configuration is read from `ZSHDL_CONFIG_DIR`, defaulting to `~/.config/zsh-dl`.

### Handlers and Preprocessors

See `dl -v --help`

### Configs

- Glob patterns:
  - Define a handler and optional postprocessor for an input pattern like so:
    - `handler(:processor)="*" # comments are allowed`
  - Handlers are matched sequentially in the order they are defined
  - Use `|` instead of `:` to continue onto other matching handlers

</br>

- Environment variables:
  - General: See `dl -v --help`
  - Specific to the example methods (these are autodetected if not declared):
    - `CLIPcmd`
    - `PASTEcmd`
    - `FORMATPYTHONcmd`
    - `HTML2MARKDOWNcmd`
    - `YTDLPcmd`
    - `IMAGESDLcmd`

</br>

- Sourcing:
  - Different configs are defined as seperate `name`.ini files
  - For convenience, configs can be invoked with `<nickname>` where `<nickname>` is any string such that there is only one config that has it as an initial substring.
  - Before running, all corresponding `<name>_*.zsh` files along with the preinstalled `handlers.zsh` and `postprocessors.zsh` in the config directory are sourced.

# Future directions [^8]

- ~~Use a more powerful expression language than glob~~  
- ~~Advanced mime detection~~  
- ~~Lessfilter implementation~~  
- ~~Even more generalized composition~~  
- ~~Draw a diagram~~  
- ~~Daemonize~~  
- ~~Support passing flags to handlers~~  
- ~~Maintain an input history to resume from in case of early exit~~  
- ~~Buffer tty read + write requests with redraw~~  
- ~~URI handling maybe~~  
- ~~Debug empty lines on stdout~~

[^8]: These won't happen except in a rust rewrite

[^5]: i.e. lessfilter across different protocols
